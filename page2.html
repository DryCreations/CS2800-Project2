      <p>Although I said the manga is still going it has been on hiatus for over a year due to the authors health issues, you can see a live hiatus chart <a href="https://hiatus-hiatus.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>. Normally manga is printed in black and white, however due to the absence of new material from the author many chapters are being rereleased in color, hover over the image below to see the full color page of the manga.</p>
